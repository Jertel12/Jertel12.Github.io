      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my names Jack Ertel and I was born and raised on the upper east side of Manhattan, New York. I graduated from the University of Miami and was a dual major in Media Managment and Music Business. I hope to someday work at a record label in either promotions or Artist and Development (A&R). I have loved music my entire life playing multiple instruments such as the Trumpet, Drums, and Clarinet since the 4th grade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing my deep love for music, my uncle took me under his wing and let me do multiple internships at his music publishing company. I learned some of the most valuable lessons about the music industry and myself in these years. With this knowledge I was able to recognize that I wanted to work for the creative side of the business rather than the publishing.

      <h2>Why Hip-Hop?</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in New York City, Hip-Hop and Rap music played an incredibly influential part of me becoming the person I was today. I looked up to artists like 50 Cent, who when met with adversity stood tall and showed those who wronged him that he wouldn't allow them to push him around anymore. The first album I ever owned was Kanye West's the college dropout which tells the story of Mr. West's redeption after being told "that he would never ammount to anything" his entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stories like these are why I want to work in the Hip-Hop and Rap industry and hopefully help more people get out of hard situations with their immense talent. Hip-Hop is not able to stay relevant without people who specifically are employed to go out and constantly be finding new talent. I hope one day that I will be able to be one of those people.

      <h2>2020 Rappers Wrapped</h2>
      <p>
        The first of my works that I will be showcasing is my 2020 Rappers Wrapped project. This is an infographic I created while pretending to be Spotify that shows how the top 10 rapppers made out for themselves finnancially during the pandemic year. I took their net worths and compared it to how much money they made during 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project I also had to describe how the COVID-19 virus and complete government shutdown affected the music business.
