      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my names Jack Ertel and I was born and raised on the upper east side of Manhattan, New York. I graduated from the University of Miami and was a dual major in Media Managment and Music Business. I hope to someday work at a record label in either promotions or Artist and Development (A&R). I have loved music my entire life playing multiple instruments such as the Trumpet, Drums, and Clarinet since the 4th grade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing my deep love for music, my uncle took me under his wing and let me do multiple internships at his music publishing company. I learned some of the most valuable lessons about the music industry and myself in these years. With this knowledge I was able to recognize that I wanted to work for the creative side of the business rather than the publishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in New York City, Hip-Hop and Rap music played an incredibly influential part of me becoming the person I was today. I looked up to artists like 50 Cent, who when met with adversity stood tall and showed those who wronged him that he wouldn't allow them to push him around anymore. The first album I ever owned was Kanye West's the college dropout which tells the story of Mr. West's redeption after being told "that he would never ammount to anything" his entire life. Stories like these are why I want to work in the Hip-Hop and Rap industry and hopefully help more people get out of hard situations with their immense talent.

        A big problem in Japan today is acid rain. This is caused by air
        pollution emitted from nuclear power plants. When this acidic rain is
        precipitated it contaminates lakes and resevoirs degrading the country's
        water quality and harming their aquatic life. This causes a major
        depletion of Japans two largest economic markets, Fish and Tropical
        Limber.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japan originally planned to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima
        disaster in 2011. Although recently they have implemented a new policy
        to restart nuclear power and keep them under strict saftey regulations.
