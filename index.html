  <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> The Tokugawa Shogunate isued a era of isolation within Japan in 1603. This would last two centuries and would allow Japan's indeginous culture to blossum into what is today. The ports of Japan wouldn't open again until 1854 with the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa, causing massive industrialzation within the country.</p>
    <p> Throughout the late 19th and 20th century Japan would see itself become a powerhouse of the Asian reigion defeating both China and Russia. Japan would go on to occupy many countries during this time, said countries are listed below in chronological order. </p>
     <ol>
       <li>Korea</li>
       <li>Formosa (tiwan)</li>
       <li>Souther Sakhil Island</li>
       <li>Manchuria</li>
    </ol>
  <p> In 1941 Japan attacked the United States in the bombing of Pearl Harbor causing their involvement in World War II. This action caused the only two nuclear weapons to be dropped on Japanese soil in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The countrt would bounce back from this massive blow however allying with the US and becoming an economic giant.</p>
