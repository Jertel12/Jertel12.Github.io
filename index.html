      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        MAKE THIS AN INTRO ABOUT YOU In 1941 Japan attacked the United States in
        the bombing of Pearl Harbor causing their involvement in World War II.
        This action caused the only two nuclear weapons to be dropped on
        Japanese soil in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The countrt would
        bounce back from this massive blow however allying with the US and
        becoming an economic giant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new age of Japan would also lead to political change within the
        country. While the emperor would still keep his throne they would be
        considered figureheads. Politicans would now be elected and given
        dicision-making power.

      <p>
        A big problem in Japan today is acid rain. This is caused by air
        pollution emitted from nuclear power plants. When this acidic rain is
        precipitated it contaminates lakes and resevoirs degrading the country's
        water quality and harming their aquatic life. This causes a major
        depletion of Japans two largest economic markets, Fish and Tropical
        Limber.

      <p>
        Japan originally planned to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima
        disaster in 2011. Although recently they have implemented a new policy
        to restart nuclear power and keep them under strict saftey regulations.
