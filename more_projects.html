        <h2>Concert review</h2>
        <p>
          For this project we had to write a review on a concert that we thought was important and impactful to the current world around us. I decided to write about artist Machine-Gun Kelly's concert in Flordia.
        <p>
          I chose this concert in particular because it was the first live show since the pandemic started. This show was crucial to the return of the music industry after the pandemic.

        <h2>MMI 173 Final Paper</h2>
        <p>
        For this assignment I needed to map out my future in the Music Industry and how I would achieve the goals I wanted. In this paper I wanted to start my own music strreaming service that gives more back to the artists while still remaining sustainable at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part of this project was to write a report on an article that involves music business. I chose the article "Spirit Acquires Production Music Library Assets Of AECG" because I specifically worked on this aquisition while I was interning at Spirit Music Group.

        <h2>Album Review</h2>
        <p>
          The final work I will showcase in this portfolio is my album review of Tha Carter V by Lil Wayne. For this assignment I had to choose an album that had recently released and that I thought was important. I selected this album because it was Lil Wayne's fifth installment of his "Tha Carter" series which had already gained immense respect in the Hip-Hop community so there was no way this one would be any different.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this review I talk about how versitile Lil Wayne is from track to track on this Album. I also describe emotionally open Lil Wayne gets with thte listener and how this is a new side that we dont get too see too often.
